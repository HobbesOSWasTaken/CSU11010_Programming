/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable and CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: I only hardcoded one value which was 100 and I believe that to be ok.
   2. Did I format the variable and CONSTANT names properly (in lowerCamelCase and UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: I used UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for all final constants and lowerCamelCase for all variables
   3. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: Every line is indented correctly and ony one line ran off screen requiring splitting it in half and further indentation below it.
   4. Did I read the input correctly from the user using appropriate questions?
       Mark out of 15: 13
       Comment: I followed the specified questions exactly and clearly however I do think they could've been more specific,
                for example one's commute cost can change each week not just month.
   5. Did I compute the disposable income and disposable income percentage correctly, and output it in the correct format?
       Mark out of 15: 14
       Comment: I computed everything correctly and outputted the disposable income as a double. However I chose to output the income percentage as a rounded off double with no decimal points.
                This could've been made to round to more decimal points and therefore more accurate.
  6. Did I use an appropriate series of if statements to generate the income analysis to the user?
       Mark out of 25:  23
       Comment: I minimised the amount of if statements that I used by including && in some statements.
                I also used an else statement to cover the final output as all other possibilities were covered already.
                I docked marks as it would have been much shorter to use ? and : to do the same things that I did
   7. Did I provide the correct output for each possibility in an easy to read format?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: Each possibility produces a clear and concise output to tell the user how close they are to the average disposable income
   8. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5: 5
       Comment: I could've explained myself slightly better in comments but it is understandable.
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks): 95
